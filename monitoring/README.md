## Virtual environment:

 1. Create a venv using this:
 ```bash
 cd monitoring
 . /opt/homebrew/anaconda3/bin/activate #activate conda
pipenv install --python 3.11
pipenv shell
 ```

 3. If you have already created this environment and want to activate it later on, use the following:
 ```bash
 . /Users/aasth/.local/share/virtualenvs/monitoring-rO_KQq52/bin/activate
 ```

 4.
 
 Make sure to have the docker app running and the `docker-compose up --build` command running in a terminal with the py11 enviroment before proceeding to the next step.

Once the above file is ready, open up a terminal with `monitoring` environment and folder and run `prefect project init`. You'll get a list of options to choose from. Hit enter on "docker" and enter the image_name as `evidently-prefect` and the tag as `prefect`.

Open up another terminal with `monitoring` where you will run `prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api` and then run `prefect server start`

Open up another terminal with `monitoring`, now run `python evidently_metrics_calculation.py`:

When you log into Adminer at localhost:8080 with the credentials mentioned in the evidently_metrics_calculation.py, you'll see that the `evidently_metrics` table now has updated information:

Then in another tab, open up Grafana by going to localhost:3000 and enter admin as both username and password. Create a new visualization using PostgreSQL as the system (cause we updated it with information):

5. To save the grafana dashboard:

I have created a [grafana dashboards file](./config/grafana_dashboards.yaml) where I have used a standard configuration format that is used when creating dashboards. I also created a [data_drift.json](./dashboards/data_drift.json) file that contains the JSON model of the dashboard that I want to save.
